The purpose of this project was to implement a simulation of the game 6 Nimmt!

main.py: runs a simulation of the game and prints results as specified
dealer.py: implements the dealer to run a simulation of the game
player.py: implements card and a player to use in running the simulation
test_dealer.py: contains tests for the dealer
run_tests.sh: runs tests for the implementation

To run the simulation, run:
python main.py

To run tests, run:
./run_tests.sh

Read the code in the following order:
player.py
dealer.py
main.py
